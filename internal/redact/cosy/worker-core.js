// (Apache-2.0; upstream notice in NOTICE). Extracted 2026-09-25
// by scripts/extract-cosy-core.py — do not hand-edit; re-run the extractor instead.
// Changes vs upstream (logic-preserving, documented in the extractor):
//   - HTTP proxy shell removed (routing/CORS/header-filter/fetch handler/ReadableStream
//     restoreSseStream adapter); oct drives SseRestorer.ingest/finish directly.
//   - crypto.subtle.digest(SHA-256) -> synchronous injected __octSha256Hex(str).
//   - crypto.getRandomValues -> injected __octRandomHex(nBytes).
//   - async/await removed from tokenFor/redactText/redactJson (sole async source was
//     the SHA-256 call; control flow is otherwise identical).
//   - ESM exports rewritten to a globalThis.__cosy export object for the goja runtime.
